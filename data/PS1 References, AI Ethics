Journal Article,Robles Carrillo M,Artificial intelligence: From ethics to law,Telecommunications Policy,2020,44,101937,07 2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.telpol.2020.101937,10.1016/j.telpol.2020.101937,"AI is the subject of a wide-ranging debate in which there is a growing concern about its ethical and legal aspects. Frequently, the two are mixed and confused despite being different issues and areas of knowledge. The ethical debate raises two main problems: the first, conceptual, relates to the idea and content of ethics; the second, functional, concerns its relationship with law. Both establish models of social behaviour, but they are different in scope and nature. The juridical analysis is based on a non-formalistic scientific methodology. This means that it is necessary to consider the nature and characteristics of the AI as a preliminary step to the definition of its legal paradigm. In this regard, there are two main issues: the relationship between artificial and human intelligence and the question of the unitary or diverse nature of the AI. From that theoretical and practical basis, the study of the legal system is carried out by examining its foundations, the governance model and the regulatory bases. According to this analysis, throughout the work and in the conclusions, International Law is identified as the principal legal framework for the regulation of AI."

Artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly permeates every aspect of our society, from the critical, like urban infrastructure, law enforcement, banking, healthcare and humanitarian aid, to the mundane like dating. AI, including embodied AI in robotics and techniques like machine learning, can improve economic, social welfare and the exercise of human rights. Owing to the proliferation of AI in high-risk areas, the pressure is mounting to design and govern AI to be accountable, fair and transparent. How can this be achieved and through which frameworks? This is one of the central questions addressed in this special issue, in which eight authors present in-depth analyses of the ethical, legal-regulatory and technical challenges posed by developing governance regimes for AI systems. It also gives a brief overview of recent developments in AI governance, how much of the agenda for defining AI regulation, ethical frameworks and technical approaches is set, as well as providing some concrete suggestions to further the debate on AI governance."
Journal Article,"Jobin A,Ienca M,Vayena E",The global landscape of AI ethics guidelines,Nature Machine Intelligence,2019,1,389-399,09 2019,https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-019-0088-2;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s42256-019-0088-2,10.1038/s42256-019-0088-2,"In the past five years, private companies, research institutions and public sector organizations have issued principles and guidelines for ethical artificial intelligence (AI). However, despite an apparent agreement that AI should be ‘ethical’, there is debate about both what constitutes ‘ethical AI’ and which ethical requirements, technical standards and best practices are needed for its realization. To investigate whether a global agreement on these questions is emerging, we mapped and analysed the current corpus of principles and guidelines on ethical AI. Our results reveal a global convergence emerging around five ethical principles (transparency, justice and fairness, non-maleficence, responsibility and privacy), with substantive divergence in relation to how these principles are interpreted, why they are deemed important, what issue, domain or actors they pertain to, and how they should be implemented. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating guideline-development efforts with substantive ethical analysis and adequate implementation strategies."

This comprehensive review aims not only to surface the underlying ethical and legal but also social implications (ELSI) that have been overlooked in recent reviews while deserving equal attention in the development stage, and certainly ahead of implementation in healthcare. It is intended to guide various stakeholders (eg. designers, engineers, clinicians) in addressing the ELSI of AI at the design stage using the Ethics by Design (EbD) approach."

Humanity has witnessed unprecedented technological advances with respect to artificial intelligence (AI), which now impacts our daily lives through e.g. our smartphones and the Internet of Things. AI determines the result of our credit and loan applications; in the United States, it often informs parole decisions; and it pervades our work environments."

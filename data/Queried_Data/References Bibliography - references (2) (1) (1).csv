Journal Article,Ozimek A,The Future of Remote Work,SSRN Electronic Journal,2020,,,,05 2020,,https://content-static.upwork.com/blog/uploads/sites/6/2020/05/26131624/Upwork_EconomistReport_FWR_052020.pdf;http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3638597,10.2139/ssrn.3638597,,"The impact of COVID-19 on the way that we work arguably represents the most drastic and rapid shift to the global workforce that we have seen since World War II. This paper investigates the long term impacts of this remote work experiment and what we can anticipate in the future, based on the direct impact that COVID has had on hiring, sentiments around remote work, and plans moving forward. The analysis uses two waves of survey data: one fielded prior to the pandemic in November 2019, and the other fielded during the pandemic in April 2020. The surveys polled a combined 1,500 hiring managers which includes executives, VPs, and managers- so the results reflect the views and plans of those with direct influence over businesses’ remote work decisions. In short, these results provide before and after snapshots of how relevant decision makers view the remote work experiment so far and how it has affected their plans. The results suggest that the remote work experiment has gone better than expected for hiring managers. The perceived benefits of working remotely are causing businesses to significantly increase plans for remote hiring in the future, which will cause an acceleration in the already upward trend of greater remote work."

Journal Article,"Brynjolfsson E,Horton J,Ozimek A,Rock D,Sharma G,TuYe HY",COVID-19 and remote work: An early look at US data,National Bureau of Economic Research,2020,,,,06 2020,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3386/w27344,10.3386/w27344,,"We report the results of a nationally-representative sample of the US population during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey ran in two waves from April 1-5, 2020 and May 2-8, 2020. Of those employed pre-COVID-19, we find that about half are now working from home, including 35.2% who report they were commuting and recently switched to working from home. In addition, 10.1% report being laid-off or furloughed since the start of COVID-19. There is a strong negative relationship between the fraction in a state still commuting to work and the fraction working from home. We find that the share of people switching to remote work can be predicted by the incidence of COVID-19 and that younger people were more likely to switch to remote work. Furthermore, states with a higher share of employment in information work including management, professional and related occupations were more likely to shift toward working from home and had fewer people laid off or furloughed. We find no substantial change in results between the two waves, suggesting that most changes to remote work manifested by early April."

In the midst of a pandemic caused by the COVID-19 virus, this way of working has become an inevitable form of business. Overnight, one had to adjust to the “new normality” and accept a new way of working from home. This way of working has positive and negative effects on the job itself and on the individual. These issues have been addressed in a number of studies that have identified different impacts of distance business on productivity, as well as on all participants in the business process. Research shows that there are a number of positive effects on employees of different companies, but also some negative effects. Most of the research covered by this paper, 81.82% of them, found that this way of working has no negative effects on productivity. Also, 63.64% of papers showed that the consequences for employees are mostly positive. Remote work has had a number of implications for businesses and individuals as it has become more widespread, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. While it has been shown to have mostly positive effects on productivity and employee well-being in many studies, there are also some negative impacts that have been identified. It is important for businesses and individuals to carefully consider the benefits and drawbacks of remote work and to implement strategies to address any potential negative effects."
Journal Article,"Fan W,Moen P","Ongoing Remote Work, Returning to Working at Work, or in between during COVID-19: What Promotes Subjective Well-being?",Journal of Health and Social Behavior,2023,,2214652211502,,01 2023,2023-02-28,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00221465221150283,10.1177/00221465221150283,,"The COVID-19 pandemic precipitated a massive turn to remote work, followed by subsequent shifts for many into hybrid or fully returning to the office. To understand the patterned dynamics of subjective well-being associated with shifting places of work, we conducted a nationally representative panel survey (October 2020 and April 2021) of U.S. employees who worked remotely at some point since the pandemic (N = 1,817). Cluster analysis identified four patterned constellations of well-being based on burnout, work–life conflict, and job and life satisfaction. A total return to office is generally more stressful, leading to significantly lower probabilities of being in the optimal low stress/high satisfaction constellation by Wave 2, especially for men and women without care obligations. Remote and hybrid arrangements have salutary effects; moving to hybrid is especially positive for minority men and less educated men, although it disadvantages White women’s well-being."

This scoping review analyzed academic and gray literature to investigate the benefits and challenges created by remote work and the strategies related to the ways in which these challenges could be potentially addressed. The published research on remote work is interdisciplinary, non-sector-specific, and often theoretical. Remote work was reported to bring benefits and challenges for companies and employees; some of which are shared between these stakeholders. Several recommendations emerged on maximizing the benefits of remote work. The results provide an overview of the field to date, indicating the directions for future developments and scholarly and market demands. This aspect will guarantee future research and provide a base for practitioners and policymakers to design more tailored and evidence-informed strategies."

However, workers’ economic–financial perception of remote working conditions, such as digital technology and its implementation, has scarcely been researched. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the economic–financial impacts of remote working on labourers. Using a mixed-methods sequential exploratory design, a sample of 976 workers is investigated. This study highlights that the majority of workers experience a negative economic–financial impact due to the additional costs incurred for digital technology and platforms and for utilities as well as the non-payment of overtime and meal vouchers, which are higher than the savings in commuting costs and out-of-pocket expenses. Furthermore, this research emphasizes that psychological–behavioural variables, specifically job satisfaction and technostress, are essential in the choice to continue working remotely after the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, our results have important theoretical implications related to the existing literature both on the managerial issues connected to digital transformation, with interdisciplinary elements linked to psychological aspects, and on corporate finance topics associated to the economic–financial impacts of remote working."

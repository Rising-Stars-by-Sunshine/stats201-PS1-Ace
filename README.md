## Project Summary
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of various token data from Infura, alchemy, and QuickNode. Specifically, Ace analyzed ERC20 and ERC271 tokens, focusing on Chainlink and tokens from the Bored Ape Yacht Club, respectively. In addition, the project also involves an extensive literature review of AI Ethics, analyzing a pool of papers to establish word connections. The project utilized advanced data analytics tools to identify the most commonly used words in the title and abstract, as well as the most frequently paired words.
